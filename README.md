#Compression Comparison
By: Ryne Storey
To run- 
1.type make
2.type ./tester and then the text files that you want to be compressed

This program was made to compare the quality of compression between different algortihms on different kinds of text files
There are currently bugs in the project, I couldn't get the algorithm up and running and am getting segmentation faults. I implemented command line arguments where the user can select the text files they wish to use and a modular design to add more algortihms in the future.
